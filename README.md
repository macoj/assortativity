# Bias and limitations in nominal assortativity to assessing homophily in networks
Nominal assortativity (or attribute assortativity) is widely used to characterize group mixing patterns in networks, enabling researchers to analyze how social groups interact with one another. In this paper, we demonstrate that the measure presents severe shortcomings when applied to networks with unequal group sizes and asymmetric mixing. We use different types of synthetic networks to show that nominal assortativity fails to account for group imbalance and asymmetric group interactions, thereby producing an inaccurate characterization of mixing patterns. To overcome this issue, we propose the *adjusted nominal assortativity* and show that this new measure correct for assortativity that we would expect from the homophily in networks. We show how this new insight enable to uncover the hidden assortativity in empirical networks.
